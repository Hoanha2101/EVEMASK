/**
 * ModernSiteLayout Component - Future Layout System
 * 
 * This file is reserved for a modern layout system that may be implemented
 * in future versions of the EVEMASK website. Currently, it serves as a
 * TypeScript module placeholder.
 * 
 * Potential future features:
 * - Advanced layout management
 * - Dynamic grid systems
 * - Enhanced responsive design
 * - Layout configuration options
 * - Modern CSS Grid and Flexbox utilities
 * 
 * For now, the main layout is handled by FullSiteComponent.tsx
 * which contains all the website sections and layout logic.
