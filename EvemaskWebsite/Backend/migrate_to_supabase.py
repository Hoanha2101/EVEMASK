===========================
EVEMASK Data Migration Tool
===========================

This script migrates subscriber data from local JSON files to Supabase PostgreSQL database.

Migration Process Overview:
1. JSON File Analysis:
   - Validates existing subscribers.json structure
   - Counts total records and identifies data quality issues
   - Creates backup before migration starts

2. Supabase Connection Test:
   - Verifies database credentials and connectivity
   - Tests table schema and permissions
   - Validates required database objects exist

3. Data Migration Pipeline:
   - Reads JSON records in batches for memory efficiency
   - Transforms data format to match database schema
   - Handles duplicate detection and resolution
   - Performs incremental migration with progress tracking

4. Verification and Cleanup:
   - Compares record counts between source and destination
   - Validates data integrity post-migration
   - Generates detailed migration report
   - Provides rollback instructions if needed

Migration Flow:
[JSON File] -> [Data Validation] -> [Supabase Insert] -> [Verification] -> [Report]
     |              |                      |                 |             |
  (Backup)    (Schema Check)         (Batch Process)   (Count Check)  (Summary)

Error Handling:
- Connection failures: Retry with exponential backoff
- Duplicate records: Skip with detailed logging
- Data format issues: Transform or report as errors
- Partial failures: Continue migration and report issues

Safety Features:
- Automatic backup creation before migration
- Dry-run mode for testing without actual changes
- Rollback capability for error recovery
- Comprehensive logging for audit trails
